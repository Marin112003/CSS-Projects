3. **Card ace of spades** - This project presents a design of the Ace of Spades card.

4. **Codepen tile** - This project represents a CodePen Tile, which is a styled card element. The most challenging aspect of this project was achieving responsiveness and precise element positioning. In this design, the tile includes hover effects: when the pointer hovers over the tile, like and comment icons appear, adding an interactive element to the design.
